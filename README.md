# Welcome

This is my implementation (mostly copy-and-paste) of a few data structures in JavaScript.

I got a lot of this info from the following:

- Video: [Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2CEgPsws3U)
- Long article: [Data Structures in JavaScript: Arrays, HashMaps, and Lists](https://adrianmejia.com/data-structures-time-complexity-for-beginners-arrays-hashmaps-linked-lists-stacks-queues-tutorial/)
- Short article: [Implementation of Binary Search Tree in Javascript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-binary-search-tree-javascript/)
